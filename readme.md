# Building, wait a minute. Who are you???

-------

# Context

I have a list of previous analyzed brazilian stocks and reets to buy, but I want to buy it only when it's falling (not stonks).
In my strategy it will increase my possibility to obtain gains, as long it was analyzed by professional research (stonks).
If you don't understand, fck. ¯\_( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)_/¯

Based in https://github.com/mv/fundamentus-api to get data from www.fundamentus.com.br. I don't now somewhere stocks data can be accessed for free ;), if you know, PLEASE tell me. ᕙ( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)ᕗ
